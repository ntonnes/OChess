## OChess: an OCaml chess engine
The implementation of the chess game logic itself is written entirely in standard OCaml, and will be made to function in the 
toplevel. The GUI is written in OCaml using the [TSDL](https://github.com/dbuenzli/tsdl/) package. All source code is entirely 
original and written from scratch.

## About
This is a personal project inspired by a class I took in functional programming at McGill University. I enjoyed learning OCaml, 
and I wanted to make something larger than the assignments we had to complete for class. In light of my recent interest in 
getting good at chess, I decided to make a simple chess engine with OCaml. I had originally intended to use OCaml's graphics 
package for the GUI, but decided to use TSDL instead, which provides bindings for SDL in OCaml.
